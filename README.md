# Gender and Framing Effects on Financial Decision-Making

## Abstract
An unprecedented and growing volume of multimodal data is exerting influence on consumers’ decision-making process, particularly in the realm of finance. Automated text analysis has not only proven to be a valuable method for companies to improve their marketing effectiveness, it also gives consumers a glimpse into an advertiser's bag of tricks, helping them to make decisions based solely on their own judgement. This research, consisting of three studies, analyzed 300 transcribed video advertisements and found that advertisers use positive language to increase effectiveness and memorability (Study 1). Study 2 demonstrates that the topic of finance is greatly associated with masculine language and that financial firms tend to target a specific gender when creating their advertisements. Additionally, advertisers use concrete language to help viewers envision their products and keep them present throughout the ad (Study 3).
